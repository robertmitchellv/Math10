    "## Discrete Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "__random variable__ is a variable that gets a numerical value assigned based on the outcome of a chance event, e.g., the monthly energy costs for homeowners in Chicago during the month of January--the number can and does vary.  Additionally, this could be the number of teenagers diagnosed with high blood pressure in a random sample of 100 teenagers in the state of Texas--the number could be any whole number between 0 and 100 and would vary from sample to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we remember, a __discrete random variable__ is one which actually counts the possible responses, and that a __continuous random variable__ is one that takes on the values in an interval.  Now we classify each of the random variables in the examples above as either \"discrete\" or \"continuous\"\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The energy example is continusous because costs are not something we count; they are not whole numbers.\n",
    "+ The teenager example is discrete because number is something we can count using whole numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "We will spend this chapter focusing on discrete random variables.  A large number of applied problems in probability and statistics involve situations where an experiment is performed several times, and in which there are only two possible outcomes on any given __trial__.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A __trial__ is a word used to describe performing the experiment one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Consider testing the effectiveness of a drug.  Several patients take the drug (the trials) and, for each patient, the drug is either effective or not effective(the two possible outcomes). \n",
    "+ Consider the weekly sales of a car salesperson.  The salesperson has several customers during the week (the trials) and, for each customer, the salesperson either makes a sale or does not make a sale (the two possible outcomes)\n",
    "+ Consider a taste test for colas.  A number of people taste two different colas (the trials) and, for each person, the preference is either for the first cola or the second cola (the two possible outcomes)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Terminology__\n",
    "+ __Trial__ describes repitition of the basic experiment\n",

    "+ F = a failure\n",

    "$$p = P(S) = the\\;probability\\;of\\;success \\\\\n",
    "q = 1 - p = P(F) = the\\;probability\\;of\\;failure$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick look at the formula for failure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q = 1 - p\\;\\;because\\;\\;P(S) + P(F) = 1 \\therefore p + q = 1 \\therefore q = 1 - p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Bernoulli trials__ are repeated trials--provided each of the following are true:\n",
    "+ the result of each trial is classified as either the occurence (success) or non-occurence (failure) of a specified event\n",
    "+ the trials are independent of one another\n",
    "+ the proability, p, of a success remains the same from trial to trial\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bottom Line\n",
    "A __binomial experiment__ consists of running _n_ Bernoulli trials and counting the number of successes.  That is, X is said to be a binomial random variable if X is the number of successes in _n_ Bernoulli trials.\n",
