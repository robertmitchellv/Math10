    "+ __Population__: The Entire group of interest\n",
    "+ __Sample__: A subset of the population.\n",

    "Gathering __population__ level data can be very costly, which is why __sampling__ is so important.  Additionally, __sampling__ becomes our go-to method for gathering data that would be impossible to gather of an entire __population__.\n",
    "\n",
    "THe ultimate goal of statistics is to take the sample data and use it to make conclusions about the entire population.  If proper sampling techniques are used then we have a very good chance of making accurate predeictions about a very large set of data (the __population__) from a much smaller set (the __sample__).\n",

    "\n",
    "+ __Quantitative__: Numerical data that has meaning, e.g., the miles per gallon the hybrid Prius gets, your height, your GPA.\n",
    "    * __Discrete__: you can count the possible responses, e.g., number of glases of water you drank today, the number of cigarettes you smoke daily, or the number of accidents at an intersection.\n",
    "    * __Continuous__: you can give this variable an interval, e.g., age falls on a continuum; as do amounts, such as, the amount of water you drank today, the amount of barbon dioxide your car emits, or the volume of water in a backyard pool. \n",
    "+ __Qualitative__: Non-numerical data, e.g., the political party you belong to, or whether or not you have a bumper sticker, or your gender.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. A __question__ needs answering\n",
    "2. Collect __data__ (using a procedure--such as random sampling--to increase the chance of a representative sample.\n",
    "3. __Classify__ the data as either qualitative or quantitative (then as discrete or continuous if quantitative).\n",
    "4. __Summarize__ the data using a picture or summary number (like batting average).\n",
    "5. __Analyze__ the data (this is what the most interesting part of this course is about).\n",
    "6. __Interpret__.  Based on the sample data collected, make a conclusion about the population."
