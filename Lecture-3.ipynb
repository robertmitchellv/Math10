    "Some common questions often asked and answered in probability and statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ What is the probability that when rolling a pair of dice the sum will be a \"seven\"?\n",
    "+ What is the probability that when rolling a single die the result will be a \"two\" knowing that the result is an even number?\n",
    "+ What is the probability that you will win a state lottery if you buy a ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you use a sample of 20 medium to large consumer electronics coporations to estimate the average gross sales in US dollars of all medium to large consumer electronics corporations.  In this situation, you would be using the sample mean to make an inference about the true population mean, and we would want to have some idea of how accurate the sample mean is as a true reflection of the population mean.  Probability is required for a measure of reliability of such inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such inferences are not usually made without some measure of reliabilty of the inference.  Measures of reliabilty provide us with a sense of how confident we are that the inference is a good one.  In case that the confidence of the inference is low, then usually the inference would not be used or at least not trusted to be very accurate.  Either way a measure of reliability is important to know.  We use probability to obtain measures of reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ __Experiement__: Some course of action taken without being sure of what the eventual outcome will be.\n",
    "+ __Outcome__: What happens after the experiment\n",
    "+ __Event__: One of the things that could happen when an experiement is performed.\n",
    "+ __Probability__: A measure of how likely it is that a particular event will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we take a pair of dice and take one of the dice, called a die.  THen we perform the __experiment__ of rolling the die.  Next we record the __outcome__ of the experiment.  This will be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or a 6.  Now define the __event__ of interested to be that we get a 2 when we roll the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explain explain the basic and intuitive idea of \"probability\" by continuing with the example of the experiment of rolling a die with an interest in finding the __probability__ that the __event__ of obtaining an __outcome__ of 2 occurs.  When a tie is actually rolled the __outcome__ can be any one of the first six numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 5.  So the total number of possible __outcomes__ is 6.\n",

    "Now, we could have obtained a 2 on the first roll, or 5, or 4, et cetera.  One could loose patience and give up--the goal of probability is to figure out the probability of a particular event without actually performing an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are six possible outcomes when rolling a single die, then intuitively the probability of obtaining a 2 on a single toss is defined to be one chance in six.  We justify this based on there being one way of obtaining a 2 out of six total outcomes, or:\n",
    "\n",

    "Another way to look at this is that if one rolls the die many times and counts the number of times the die comes up 2, then the ration of the number of times one obtains a 2 to the number of times one rolls the die should be close to one-sixth.  Here's our basic probability formula:\n",

    "In general, a __probability__ is a number between __0__ and __1__ which describes the likellihood that an outcome or an event occurs when an experiment is performed.  Probabilities are assigned to outcomes based on the frequency of occurence if the experiement were to be repeated many times.  For example, if a balanced coin were tossed twice, you would expect that each of the outcomes HH, HT, TH, and TT would occur with a frequency of about 1 in 4.  That is, if you tossed the coin twice and repeated that for 100 times, you would expect that approximately 25 times you would obtain 2 heads.  Although the number could be different, the final count should be somewhere near 25 occurences of two heads.  Otherwise, the coin you are tossing is said to be not balanced or not fair.\n",
